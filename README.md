## Share A Meal

## Idea brief: Share A Meal
I have decided to create a website with the objective of feeding the needy, as you all know, weddings and functions are very common in India, and they also tend to prepare a lot of food in such events. But at the end of the day, we all know that a lot of food will be wasted or thrown away as leftovers. So, my website will act like a middleman between these event organizers and the NGOs who feed the needy. The initial function of this website which I have in mind is to allow the event organizers to create an alert which displays the details about the food available and the NGOs to accept the food donation according to their needs.
